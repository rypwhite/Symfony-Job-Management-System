# Symfony-Job-Management-System
A job management system using the symfony PHP framework

This was a project to show off my understanding of simple CRUD using symfony - this includes an authentication system, 
create job listings, view job listings as well as viewing individual jobs, updating listings and delete listings. The
Administrator account (account with ROLE_ADMIN) can see the management tabs + views but user accounts cannot.

On the agenda could be a user management system, CV upload point and profile system.

Here is the very basic, barebones landing page view - this was made using bootstrap and basic components.
